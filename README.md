In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article. Fandango displays a 5-star rating system on their website, where the minimum rating is 0 stars and the maximum is 5 stars.
Fandango's officials replied that the biased rounding off was caused by a bug in their system rather than being intentional, and they promised to fix the bug as soon as possible. In this project, we'll analyze more recent movie ratings data to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis.
